# my_spotify

Possible goals for this project
-
- Analyzing my own listening habits, like which audio statistics (danceability, speechiness, etc) are most prevalent in my playlists
- Advanced playlist editor/creator with accompanying GUI
- Analyzing what components of a song lead it to have the most streams/popularity- artist popularity and num followers, country, audio stats, release year, song length, genre
- Analyzing what properties make an artist have more popularity - amount of total songs, amount of albums, time since first song, genre, country

Getting started: what properties make an artist have more popularity?
-
- decided to start by pulling artist data. I plan to use Python to do this (found the spotipy package) and R to perform the statistical analysis and visualization
- tracks and artists have a popularity metric generated by spotify which I think is probably the best metric to judge their popularity rather than raw numbers like number of streams or followers
- In the app you can see artists have ratings but this data seems very hard to find.
- Luckily, one guy was also frustrated by this problem and build an app to pull the top 500 artists from spotify every day: https://eduardlupu.github.io/spotify-artists/
- On 7/16/25 I downloaded the top artists json file from his github: https://github.com/EduardLupu/spotify-artists
- The order of the artists doesn't matter, I just want 500 popular artists to analyze. I will pull out their names from the json and then use the Spotify Web API to get their ids and associated stats
