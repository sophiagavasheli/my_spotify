# my_spotify

Possible goals for this project:
- Analyzing my own listening habits, like which audio statistics (danceability, speechiness, etc) are most prevalent in my playlists
- Advanced playlist editor/creator with accompanying GUI
- Analyzing what components of a song lead it to have the most streams
-     artist popularity (num followers), country, audio stats, release year, song length, genre
- Analyzing what properties make an artist have more popularity
-     amount of total songs, amount of albums, time since first song, genre, country
